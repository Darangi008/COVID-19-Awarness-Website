        avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.</p>

    <p class="final-paragraph">If you do leave your home to go to a care facility, wear a mask so your coughs and sneezes are less likely to infect
    others. (Masks are NOT recommended for healthy people in the general population.)
    Wash your hands thoroughly (for at least 20 seconds) after sneezing, blowing your nose, coughing or using the bathroom,
    and before preparing or eating food.
    At home, clean often-touched surfaces such as doors and doorknobs, cabinet handles, bathroom hardware, tabletops,
    phones, tablets and keyboards regularly with disinfectant.</p>
